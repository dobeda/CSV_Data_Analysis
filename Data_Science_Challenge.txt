Question 1:
A) While Average Order Value (AOV) sounds useful, it is a garbage metric when we have out of place orders
   that will throw the numbers off and not be an accurate represetation of the every day customers order.
   The order in question that is throwing everything off contained 2000 different items, when in reality
   the average customer only ordered two. (1.99)

B) A more useful metric to go by, would be a combination of the Average Order Volume (How many items in an order)
   when you exclude the outliers that dont represent an everyday customer, and then combining that with the average
   item value. These two seperate metrics can give us a new, more representative AOV, while giving us an idea what
   the actual average order looks like.

C) The new Average Order Volume metric, gives us an average of 1.99 items per customer, with an expected 
   value of &754.09 per order. When we include the outliers we have the 
   unbeleivable 8.79 items per customer at an Average Order Value of $3145.13


Question 2:
A) Speedy Express shipped a total of 54 orders. 

SELECT COUNT(ShipperID) AS "Speedy Orders"
FROM Orders
WHERE ShipperID=1;

B) Peacock is the lastname of the employee with the most orders

SELECT COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS "Orders Made", Employees.LastName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.LastName
ORDER BY COUNT(Orders.OrderID) DESC;


C)  Boston Crab Meat sold the most number of items in Germany, at 160 units.

SELECT SUM(orderDetails.Quantity) AS "Germany Sales", OrderDetails.ProductID, ProductName
FROM (((OrderDetails
INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID=Products.ProductID)
INNER JOIN Orders ON OrderDetails.OrderID=Orders.OrderID)
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID)
WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany"
GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY SUM(orderDetails.Quantity) DESC;
