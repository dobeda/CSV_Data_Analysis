Question 1:
A) While Average Order Value (AOV) sounds useful, it is a garbage metric when we include outliers 
   that will throw the numbers off and not be an accurate represetation of the every day customers order.
   Some of the orders in question that are throwing everything off contained 2000 different items, when in reality
   the average customer only ordered (1.99) two. While other orders contained 3 items and have a value of $77,175
   which also drastically throws off any averages.

B) A more useful metric to go by, would be the Median Order Value (MOV) as this will exclude the outliers 
   that are throwing off our data, both the high volume orders as well as the high cost per item orders.

C) The new Median Order Value (MOV) will give us a value of $284 with an expected 2 items per order vs the previous 
   8.79 items per customer at a value of $3,145.13 (on average).


Question 2:
A) Speedy Express shipped a total of 54 orders. 

SELECT COUNT(ShipperID) AS "Speedy Orders"
FROM Orders
WHERE ShipperID=1;

B) Peacock is the lastname of the employee with the most orders

SELECT COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS "Orders Made", Employees.LastName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID
GROUP BY Employees.LastName
ORDER BY COUNT(Orders.OrderID) DESC;


C)  Boston Crab Meat sold the most number of items in Germany, at 160 units.

SELECT SUM(orderDetails.Quantity) AS "Germany Sales", OrderDetails.ProductID, ProductName
FROM (((OrderDetails
INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID=Products.ProductID)
INNER JOIN Orders ON OrderDetails.OrderID=Orders.OrderID)
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID)
WHERE Customers.Country = "Germany"
GROUP BY OrderDetails.ProductID, ProductName
ORDER BY SUM(orderDetails.Quantity) DESC;
